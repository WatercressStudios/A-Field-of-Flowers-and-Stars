    voice "voice/5-scene_5-6.ogg" #Leona (Dot)

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-17.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "Not sure. Yesterday I touched up the hull and engine, but there's no power to release the hatch."

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-18.ogg" #Raine (Nat)

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-20.ogg" #Leona (Dot)

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-21.ogg" #Raine (Nat)

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-24.ogg" #Leona (Dot)

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-25.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "Then you should know the electromagnetic lock is fail secure."

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-26.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "That way, even if all power is drained, the hatch doesn't pop open in the vacuum of space."

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-27.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "I'm a bit lazy when it comes to design, so the access panel is in the hatch itself. Watch."

    na "With a screwdriver fitted with a rubber tip, I jam the tool under the panel, thus revealing an electric port."
    na "Plugging the door into the hangar's power, the lock lights up."

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-28.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "Open Sesame!"

    na "Powered up and ready to go, I turn a safety lever. The hatch hisses and slowly swings open."

# ART SHIP FOREGROUND, GARAGE BACKGROUND

    na "After a bit of sleuthing and head scratching, Leona and I have a plan to restore power to the computer."
    na "Restoring power to the entire ship will be a lot more complicated, and for that we need Juneau anyway."
    na "Too strong a source, I fry her. Too weak, and nothing happens."

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-32.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "Leona, hook the battery to the transformer you found, and that to your hanger's power source. We should be set once you're done."

    na "These past few days without Juneau have been agonizing. Even if her hardware appears to be good to go, I won't know until I boot her up."
    na " And while I've examined the ship pretty thoroughly, I haven't looked into the availability of the parts needed to get this bird off the ground again."
    na "I have a list all drawn up, but priorities are priorities."
    na "Juneau comes first, always."

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-33.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "How're we doing, Leona?"

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-34.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le "Almost got it!"

    na "She's surprisingly adept at the mechanical side of things, despite her clumsy nature."
    na "To be fair to her, she's been trying very hard to learn as much as she can. She wants to help me, bless her heart."
    na "While I could do all of this on my own, it feels good to have someone who isn't a collection of ones and zeros on my side for once."

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-35.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le "Ready!"

    na "Giving the relays one final checkup, I give Leona the word."
    na "She flips the breaker."
    na "A little bit of my anxiety fades as the power begins to flow. Step one is a success."
    na "At first, nothing happens. After I give it a few light taps, something jostles into place, and a status light blinks on."
    na "Yellow. That's better than nothing. Juneau is accepting power at least, but it needs some more time to warm up."
    na "I hook the computer into the hologram projector that they salvaged from the crash site."
    na "Just another part sucked out the ejection hatch with me, I guess."
    na "She won't be able to form hard light just yet, but at least she'll be on display."
    na "The light blinks slowly, then quickly, eventually becoming a solid green."
    na "Juneau materializes."

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-37.ogg" #Juneau (Lily)

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-38.ogg" #Raine (Nat)

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-50.ogg" #Leona (Dot)

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-52.ogg" #Juneau (Lily)
    ju "Spoil sport. Leona, let's chat~"

    na "As the two get to know each other I scour what's left of my ship."
    na "Leona's team was nice enough to bring my ship back to the city, pieces and all, but my original assessment was right - this'll be one hell of a task."
    na "Honestly, I don't know if I'll be able to get this thing flying again. So many parts are ripped up, dented, melted or downright missing."
    na "Sighing, I stretch out my arms, ready for a very, very long day."

    na "This looks absolutely ancient, but it's easily more advanced than whatever the locals have."
    na "I think I can use some of this!"

    voice "voice/5-scene_5-75.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
