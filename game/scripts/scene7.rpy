    #voice "voice/7-scene7-38.ogg" #Raine (Nat)

    #voice "voice/7-scene7-43.ogg" #Leona (Dot)

    #voice "voice/7-scene7-45.ogg" #Leona (Dot)

    le "If they were real, they wouldn't have been left behind like that."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-47.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le "Record keeping is an important part of trade, so leaving them there would be a really bad move for an employee and a nightmare for an employer."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-48.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le "But if they were a smuggler, they could just cook up another set of books."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-49.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc unimpressed "Or they were intending to get rid of evidence of smuggling, thinking nobody would find it there."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-50.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le questioning a2 "That leads me back to the stuff we found with your ship though."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-51.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le "Why go through the trouble of building something so deep inside a cave, hiding evidence of smuggling there but not leaving the smuggled cargo with it?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-52.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "I think you're onto something. It doesn't quite make sense, does it?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-53.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "Come to think of it, we found the cave because the power source inside shows up on sensors."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-54.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "You might as well leave a giant arrow pointing straight to it."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-55.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le questioning a3 "...Huh. That's a really good point."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-56.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc surprised "What if it's not a decoy, but a trap?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-57.ogg" #Leona (Dot)

    #voice "voice/7-scene7-58.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc questioning2 "Leona, what about the bodies you found?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-59.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "A room full of corpses halfway through the cave. At the back of the cave there's a sealed room and a crate full of cargo manifests just sitting there for anyone to find."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-60.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc surprised "That entire cave had to have been a trap. Whoever those people were must have been killed before they could find these manifests!"

    le "No, I-"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-65.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le "Wait. What are you getting at?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-66.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc questioning2 "What if the door is a trap set for whoever wanted to find the smuggled cargo?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-67.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "Let's consider that there isn't actually anything inside. The cargo they were looking for was actually all the way out here, buried in the middle of a forest."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-68.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc neutral "Think about it. A beacon to draw people in, trapped doors to kill off intruders and at the very back of the cave there's a pressurized room."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-69.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc questioning "Leona, what if it's a bomb?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-70.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le concerned "A bomb? I don't understand, how can a room be a bomb?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-71.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "I don't know. Maybe there's something inside set to go off as soon as..."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-72.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "...as soon as..."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-73.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc questioning2 "...the pressure is released when the door opens."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-74.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le questioning a3 "Raine, didn't that hole start making a whistling noise when you pulled that bolt out?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-75.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc unimpressed "Crap."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-76.ogg" #Leona (Dot)

    #voice "voice/7-scene7-79.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc yawn "Relax, it can't be that strong."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-80.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "Why set up traps to kill people before they can even get to the door, if opening it is just going to kill everyone anyway?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-81.ogg" #Leona (Dot)

    #voice "voice/7-scene7-97.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc "Waaait a second. If there aren't any traps before the door at the back-"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-98.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc questioning "That means the bomb might not be as small as I thought."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-99.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
    le concerned "How big do you think it could be?"
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-100.ogg" #Raine (Nat)
    mc unimpressed "I don't know. Big enough to blow away the entire cave, I imagine."
    #voice "voice/7-scene7-101.ogg" #Leona (Dot)
