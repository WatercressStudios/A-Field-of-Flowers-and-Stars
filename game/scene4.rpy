    na "After turning around and heading back to her street,  we reach the base that my poor ship has been taken to."
    na "I hope Juneau is okay, or that her programming is at least salvageable. She's annoying, but she's all I have."

    le "Hey, our base is â€“ oh, you meant your ship."
    na "I run over, pushing aside some people investigating it. They shoot me dirty looks, but upon seeing Leona, they take the hint and leave."
    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-4.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "So what's wrong with it? Not to be obtuse, but we don't exactly have ships like this on Fireside."
    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-5.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Well... first of all, it's upside down. It probably crashed that way, based on which parts took the most damage."

    le "Can you fix it?"
    na "I lean down to look at the roof of the ship, now planted into the ground, pieces of scrap metal poking out in several ugly shapes and directions."

    mc "Heh. While your baseless confidence is flattering, I think you might be overestimating me."
    na "I push together two pieces of metal, one of which was mildly bent. Holding them in place, I readjust the screw that originally held them together."

    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-35.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)

    mc "Yeah, just thinking about the ship."
    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-45.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-46.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "It's not recreating the software I can't do. It's getting back the program I had."
    na "Leona sets food down in front of me. I'm not entirely sure what it's supposed to be, but it seems she used ingredients based on what she knew I could eat."
    na "As expected, it's delicious."
    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-47.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "So what's so important about the program?"

    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-50.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Well, we had our fights, but she was the closest I had to family."
    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-51.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Like an annoying little sister."
    na "Leona's long ears seem to perk up, but she covers her expression by taking another bite of food."

    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-58.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "Here, on Fireside. Is being here somehow putting a pause on your life?"
    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-59.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    mc "I just can't take staying in one place for too long, you know? I'll feel like I'm trapped."
    na "Leona takes my empty plate back to the counter to wash it."
    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-64.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "I guess I understand. But if I had to be trapped with someone, I wouldn't mind that being you."
    na "I don't know how to react as I twiddle my thumbs, looking anywhere but at Leona."
    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-65.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "Well!"
    na "Leona's sudden change of tone catches me off guard."

    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-68.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/4-scene_4-70.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "Just doing what anyone would do. Now, make sure you get some rest! Ya need a strong and healthy mind to get her back!."
    na "I want to say something more, but I know there's nothing I can say. My thoughts return to the repair of my ship."
    na "I'm running out of time. Or I'm already out of time - I'm not sure of either. I have to assume that the wormhole won't be there forever."
    na "But there's nothing I can do until I have Juneau back, and that has to wait till tomorrow."
    na "Resigned to this fact, I follow Leona's advice and head to bed."
