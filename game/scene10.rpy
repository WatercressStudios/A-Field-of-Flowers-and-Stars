    le "Careful, there's a low hanging rock here."

    mc "Wonderful, as if I didn't need another lump."

    le "I said I was sorry..."

    mc "No, it's fine. We wouldn't be in this mess if I had checked the batteries before we left."

    le "Lucky you, I have excellent night vision."

    mc "Yeah, yeah, just lead the way you silly billy goat."

    le "You keep saying that. What's a 'goat'?"

    mc "A voracious horned devil."

    le "What's a devil?"

    mc "I'll explain later. See anything?"

    le "I think we've found somethin'. There's a lot of boxes and techy lookin' stuff all over."

    le "I'm gonna let go of you now, so I can look around."

    na "Leona releases her grip on my hand and wanders off into the dark."

    na "I stay by the opening and beat the daylights out ofinto this flashlight, hoping it isn't just a battery issue keeping me blind."

    na "With a flicker, the lights return, disorienting seemingly disorientating Leona who is already halfway across the room already."

    le "Dang, that thing really works when it works, doesn't it?"

    mc "I got sunshine in my pocket."

    na "I return to the panel we found weeks ago."

    na "With a solid thunk, I kick it the panel in hopes that doing so it might provide useful."

    na "The lights stay distinctly off, with no signout promise of light ever returning to the buttons in front of me."

    na "Something does, however, seem to come loose from below."

    le "Hehe, you remind me of a Haxine when you kick like that."

    mc "And what, pray tell, is a Haxine?"

    le "It's this big, furry beast with 6 legs and giant, flat feet from Dawne."

    le "They trample over threats. Grandpa said we used to them make roads by taunting them into chasing us back and forth between villages."

    mc "I'm no Haxawhatsit but there's a bunch of wires under here I might be able to tap into, power up the console."

    mc "Let me just pull out some of these wires, make a loop here..."

    le "What are you gonna use to power it though?"

    mc "The battery from the flashlight. It's gonna be dark in here for a moment while I connect it."

    le "Don't electrocute yourself..."

    mc "That... is a good point, actually.  Can I borrow your gloves?"

    le "Sure! Here-"

    na "Leona slips off her gloves and hands them to me."

    na "As I put one on, I notice there's extra room around the tips, and steal a glance at Leona's fingers."

    mc "Huh, your nails are wider at the tip compared to mine."

    le "Yeah, they're meant for digging and gripping stuff."

    le "My people were mountaineers and farmers. Still are, in a way."

    mc "That's funny, mine were persistence hunters and tree climbers."

    le "Ooh, so we both have gripping power."

    mc "And stubbornness."

    mc "Anyway, let's get this door open already."

    #scene black

    na "I yank the battery out and press the diode into the panel'stwisted wiring I've pulled from behind the paneling."

    na "There's a spark of electricity and a loud crack, followed by shrill creaking to our right can be heard next to us."

    mc "Is that the door moving?"

    le "You did it, it's open!"

    mc "Awesome,  just let me get this battery back where it belongs and-"

    mc "-Leona?"

    mc "Where'd you go?"

    le "Just gonna take a look see~"

    mc "Be careful, we don't know what's waiting in there!"

    le "It's fine, it's fine!"

    na "As I replace the flashlight battery, I can hear shuffling from beyond the door, followed by a loud thunk."

    mc "Everything okay!?"

    le "Uuuhh, yeah. There was a box."

    mc "...And now?"

    le "Now it's sorta... not a box?"

    mc "Did you break it?"

    le "Mmmaybe."

    #scene, cave, the lights come back on

    mc "Anything good?"

    le "Oh yeah. You're gonna love this."

    le "Get in here already!"

    #scene shift, deep cave, looks like a storage bay

    mc "Holy cow!"

    le "So, you think you'll find your parts?"

    mc "I'd be shocked if I didn't... Look at all this!"

    mc "I don't know if you guys have developed even half of this technology yet, this could be a massive discovery."

    le "And the best part, you can tell us what they are and how to use them!"

    le "This is incredible!"

    le "What's this?!"

    le "And this?!"

    na "While Leona bounds through shelf after shelf of treasures, I notice something in the corner near the door."

    mc "Whoa, talk about convenient."

    na "Leona, having thoroughly engrossed herself in exploring the room, pokes her head over a partition to see what I've found."

    mc "I found those chips I was telling you about. There's a bunch of em too."

    mc "There's enough here to power a small fleet, but it looks like one of these was vandalized at some point recently. I think it was a display case."

    na "Too recently."

    mc "Wait a minute."

    mc "Leona?"

    na "Leona has disappeared back into the labyrinth and isn't answering me."

    mc "Come out, come out, wherever you are."

    le "Don't wanna."

    mc "I'm not mad."

    le "I'm sorry..."

    mc "I told you, I'm not mad. C'mon out."

    na "Leona slinks into view, tail between her legs."

    le "Promise?"

    mc "Cross my heart and hope to die."

    le "No dying!"

    le "I don't-"

    le "- I don't want you to leave so soon is all."

    na "Leona peels open her bag and fishes out I.O.S.C. Chips."

    mc "Here, I'll trade ya."

    na "I take off Leona's gloves and offer them up."

    mc "Your gloves for the spare parts. Fair, right?"

    le "...I guess."

    mc "So?"

    le "...So..."

    na "With gloves and chips returned, Leona and I just look at each other for a moment."

    na "I understand it. A strange, new person comes out of the sky, she invites them into her home, nurses her back to health and they spend time together."

    na "But then the person starts talking about leaving almost immediately afterward."

    mc "I think I'm the one who owes you an apology here."

    mc "You know, I'm not that eager to go back up there."

    mc "It's just this isn't my home. My home is somewhere out there, on the other side of the wormhole that brought me here."

    mc "I can't even tell you how many millions of lightyears away Lumin is."

    mc "And wormholes don't stick around very long, you know?"

    mc "I'm running out of time."

    mc "If I miss the window, there's a chance I'll never be able to go back."

    le "But you already left it once, didn't you?"

    le "Why did you leave Lumin if you didn't want to get away from it?"

    le "Why can't you stay here with us, with me?"

    le "We're not super advanced like the humans, but we're not stupid, right?"

    le "We can learn! We can come join them someday!"

    le "Why not stay with me now and bring us with you?"

    mc "It's not that simple."

    mc "Please, trust me when I say if I stay here I will never be able to find human space again."

    mc "But.."

    le "But?"

    mc "But if I go back, using the information I've gathered-"

    mc "-Humanity will find Fireside again."

    mc "Beyond a shadow of a doubt, we can find this planet without the wormhole."

    le "But you'll still have to leave."

    le "And I'll be alone again until you come back."

    le "You said it yourself, your world could be millions of lightyears away. What if it doesn't happen in this lifetime?"

    na "She smiles sadly and looks away."

    le "I was excited to meet you."

    na "For a moment, I don't know how to react."

    mc "Of course meeting you has been amazing. I never thought I would meet such a beautiful and optimistic woman here here."

    na "Leona's face turns a bright red as she stares at me, speechless."

    mc "D-Don't take that the wrong way! I'm just saying that you've been the highlight of this little roadstop."

    mc "I just can't take staying in one place for too long, you know? I'll feel like I'm trapped."

    le "I guess I understand. But if I had to be trapped with someone, I wouldn't mind that being you."

    na "I don't know how to react as I twiddle my thumbs, looking anywhere but at Leona."

    mc "Then, I'll make a promise with you."

    na "Leona's eyes light up, like stars in the night."

    mc "Before I go, I'll take you up in the ship one last time. Take you up to fly with me."

    le "You'll take me with you?"

    na "I stare into them, losing myself in the soul of this shining beacon of endless possibility and give her my answer without a moment's hesitation."

    mc "Yeah, fly with me once, before I leave."

    le "Raine..."

    le "For a second, she appears disappointed, but gives in."

    na "Leona leaps at me, embracing me with the power of a bear, lifting me up and crying 'thank you! thank you!' again and again."

    na "Is this... love?"

    mc "Alright, alright, ease up there Hercules, I bruise easy!"

    le "Oop! Sorry!"

    na "Leona gingerly returns me to the planet's surface."

    mc "But first, let's worry about the here and now."

    na "Leona takes another look around the room with me."

    le "Hehe, yeah, we've got a lot of stuff to haul back to Aster."

    le "Let's grab the stuff you need for the ship and head back to the expedition team!"

    le "We'll send a message back to the city and let them handle the rest."

    le "Tonight, we celebrate!"

    mc "Onward?"

    le "ONWARD!"
