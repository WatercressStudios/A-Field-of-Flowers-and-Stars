    mc "Always."

    na "It's been a few days since I tried to get Juneau back online. Her chipset seemed healthy enough, but without a proper power source, I couldn't get her back safely."

    na "Too strong a source, I fry her. Too weak, and nothing happens."

    mc "I almost have a jury rigged battery strong enough to power Juneau. Just hook the battery to the transformer you found, and that to your hanger's power source, and we should be set."

    na "These past few days without Juneau have been agonizing. Even if her hardware appears to be good to go, I won't know until I boot her up."

    na "And the elephant in the room. Will I be able to leave?"

    na "While I've examined the ship pretty thoroughly, I haven't looked into the availability of the parts I need."

    na "I have a list all drawn up, but priorities are priorities."

    na "Juneau comes first, always."

    mc "Aaaaand… there!"

    na "I hand the cell to Leona, and she gets to work on hooking it up."

    na "She's surprisingly adept at the mechanical side of things, despite her clumsy nature."

    na "To be fair to her, she's been trying very hard to learn as much as she can. She wants to help me, bless her soul."

    na "While I could do all of this on my own, she wants to help, and it's best that I let her."

    na "It makes her really happy, and that, oddly enough, makes me pretty happy too."

    na "Leona calls from across the room."

    le "Ready!"

    na "Giving Raine's hardware one final checkup, I give Leona the word."

    na "She flips a breaker, allowing power to flow to the transformer."

    na "A little bit of my anxiety fades. The first step was successful. The nuclear plant powering the city did its job, and the transformer did the same."

    na "From there, a measured amount of electricity flows into Juneau."

    na "..."

    na "At first, nothing happens. After I give it a few light taps, something jostles into place, and a status light blinks on."

    na "Yellow. That's better than nothing. Juneau is accepting power at least, but it needs some more time to warm up."

    na "I hook Juneau up to the hologram projector I salvaged from the ship."

    na "She won't be able to formbe hard light just yet, but at least she'll be on display."

    na "The light blinks slowly, then quickly, eventually becoming a solid green."

    na "Like old times, I ignore Juneau, looking over to my pride and joy."

    na "Honestly, I don't know if I'll be able to get this thing flying again. So many parts are ripped up, dented, melted or downright missing."

    mc "Were it so easy."

    na "The bin's more of a wide, shallow dumpster full of random torn up bits, squarely sectioned off by age and origin. Thankfully, all of mine are easily accessible."

    na "I can tell the local tech apart by its abundant uselessness - none of this will help me at all. They're... well, they're a bit behind humanity in tech level."

    na "To the left of that, there's a collection of parts that I assume came from… some other civilization?"

    na "This looks absolutely ancient, but in true sci fi fashion, it's easily more advanced than whatever the locals have."

    na "Some of this I can actually use!"

    na "However, the one thing that's missing also happens to be the heart of the ship - the drive."

    na "With only the stuff on hand, I won't be able to get the ship to hover in atmosphere, let alone leave it."

    na "I back out of my workspace to see Leona perched on a nearby tool chest."

    mc "And how long have you been eavesdropping on our conversation?"

    le "Was that a conversation? I mean, I heard you talking, but that other voice was just making a bunch of weird grumbles."

    mc "Eh? Oh, right."

    mc "I guess you can't understand Juneau since she's currently keyed to English."

    na "Leona comes into the ship and sits in the pilot's seat. She inspects the display and the makeshift wiring harness I used to plug it in."

    le "You said she's a computer? Like an artificial mind?"

    mc "She's the ship's navigator persona. She helps me fly."

    le "Like a pilot?"

    mc "Hmm. More like an interface. She has software that lets her control all of the ship's systems with her mind."

    le "Is it easier that way?"

    mc "What do you mean?"

    le "You know, easier to talk to a person."

    mc "I guess. She'll even drink tea with you if the projector is working."

    le "So, what is it? The hyporo thingy"

    mc "Huh? Oh, the Hyproxy Manifold. It's basically an automatic gunk cleaner."

    le "I see. So it keeps the engines clean?"

    mc "Something like that. It cleans the residue that comes from mixing plasma with hectiactic neuroparticulates before injecting the mixture into the compression chambers."

    mc "I should be able to fabricate new ones using some of the materials in the yard, but that won't matter anyway."

    na "I pull the I.O.S.C chip from the floor and show it to Leona."

    mc "This is what's supposed to control the warp field. But it's all burned up, see?"

    le "Can't you make a new one of these too?"

    mc "Well normally, probably. Juneau has the design specifications in her head. The problem is that in order to make I.O.S.C chips, you need a stable warp field…"

    mc "And the only way to generate a warp field is to have I.O.S.Cs controlling it."

    le "Huh? How does that even work? Where did the first one come from?"

    mc "I dunno. The homeworld, I guess."

    le "By 'the homeworld', do you mean Lumin?"

    mc "No, Lumin is just one planet in the empire."

    mc "Like your people come from Dawne, my people came from a single planet too, and we made a lot of colonies. That was a really long time ago."

    le "What was it called?"

    mc "There are a few words for it. Terra, Earth, Gaea and so on."

    le "I wonder what it was like..."

    mc "I heard it was beautiful once. Humans don't have much reason to go there anymore."

    le "I think I'd still want to go see Dawne someday, even if it takes a while to get there."

    mc "How is it there?"

    le "A lot like Fireside, but there are cities everywhere."

    le "I'm happy I was born here though. Something about all the nature feels, I dunno, right?"

    mc "Hmm, you've lost me there. I prefer being up there, in space."

    le "So, if Fireside is sort of like my backyard, space is yours?"

    le "And if you find more of those chips you'll leave?"

    mc "Well..."

    mc "Even if I found more chips, they could be the wrong type, which is likely considering there's virtually zero chance of whoever was here first being human."

    mc "And if that's the case, it could take some time to reconfigure them to work in my warp drive.."

    mc "...then I could find a bunch of other problems I simply can't see yet. Once I have the parts, troubleshooting might reveal a host of other issues."

    le "So it'll be awhile?"

    mc "Probably."

    le "Well, I think I know where I can find some things that might help!"

    le "There's this cave along the route my team and I will be taking tomorrow. I scouted it out a few weeks ago, but didn't get to poke my head too far inside."

    le "There was this big metal door and a bunch of writing next to it I couldn't understand."

    mc "Ah, might they be alien ruins?"

    le "Yep! We've found quite a bit of alien remnants scattered here and there. That's where all of the extra bits and bobs came from!"

    le "Maybe it's full of money! And jewels!"

    mc "R-Right."

    na "I hope she'll find something good. I switch gears back to my ship, and Leona goes back to working on her own things."

    na "With her out of earshot, I prepare myself for the question of the century."

    na "Wiping my brow, I fall back into a nearby chair."

    mc "Juneau?"

    na "Juneau materializes, a little more nervous than usual."

    mc "You know what I'm about to ask, right?"

    ju "..."

    ju "We only have a couple more weeks left."

    ju "After that, the wormhole will close, and we'll have lost our chance."

    ju "We need the ship to be fully operational before then."

    ju "I'm afraid to ask, but... what's the verdict on that end?"

    mc "We're absolutely not going anywhere anytime soon. We're lucky enough to have the power for you to run."

    na "Juneau changes the subject in a poor attempt to lighten the mood."

    ju "If it weren't for me, the ship's reactor core would have gone critical a while ago. You're lucky to have me!"

    na "Knowing there's nothing I can really do right now, I follow suit."

    mc "You never know when an {i}accident{/i} might happen, June."

    mc "You never know."

    ju "You'd never."

    mc "Yeah, you're right. I need the ship to get out of here. Maybe I could just leave you behind, right?"

    ju "Try me."

    na  "Standing up and stretching, I give the ship a couple of pats."

    mc "I'd never."

    mc "...It's good to know you're okay, Juneau."

    ju "Likewise."

    #Slide in Leona

    le "So... are ya done yet? You've been at this for {b}ages{/b}!"

    mc "Yeah, there's not much more I can do here. I'll need to think of something."

    na "Before I run out of time."

    le "Why not join us on our next expedition on them caves!"

    le "How 'bout it?"

    mc "Worth a shot, I guess. I don't have any better ideas right now."

    le "Awesome! We'll set sail tomorrow, no time wasted!"

    mc "Wait, we're sailing?"

    mc "...I can't swim."

    le "Nonono, silly, it's just a turn of phrase."

    mc "Oh thank God."

    le "We won't be traveling by sea."

    mc "Good, good."

    #slow zoom on her face, maybe dim the screen a bit for comedic effect

    le "For the sea is deep and full of darkness."

    le "Evil things lurk just below the surface..."

    mc "What?"

    #screen abrupt cut back to normal

    le "Just kidding!"

    le "We'll be fine over land anyways! A peaceful little road trip."

    mc "R-Right."

    le "There's not a lot of water here, anyways. The cons about being so close to the sun..."

    le "I'd love to wear a swimsuit, wouldn't you?"

    le "I'd do anything to feel the sand in my toes, the water lapping up my heels, the ocean breeze biting my skin..."

    le "Space has nothing on the wonders of the terrestrial."

    mc "Well, you just haven't seen enough of space then."

    mc "And swimsuits aren't exactly my style."

    le "I'll have to show you mine later, then."

    mc "Sure, sure."

    na "Why would she have a swimsuit if this planet doesn't have a decent ocean? Are there nearby lakes or ponds that she'd frequent?"

    na "Ah, whatever. I'm good. The vacuum of space is my home. I don't need any of that sand and water and bitter, bitter ocean breeze."

    na "As our conversation draws to a close, we make our way home. We have a long day ahead of ourselves tomorrow."

    na "I just hope it works out."

    na "I'm tempted to yell out, but maybe that'd confuse her? I'm sure my voice echoing through the cave would hurt her little goat ears."
