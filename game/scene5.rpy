    na "It's been a few days since I tried to get Juneau back online. Her chipset seemed healthy enough, but without a proper power source, I couldn't get her back safely."

    mc "I almost have a jury rigged battery strong enough to power Juneau. Just hook the battery to the transformer you found, and that to your hanger's power source, and we should be set."

    na "These past few days without Juneau have been agonizing. Even if her hardware appears to be good to go, I won't know until I boot her up."

    na "And the elephant in the room. Will I be able to leave?"

    na "While I've examined the ship pretty thoroughly, I haven't looked into the availability of the parts I need."

    na "I have a list all drawn up, but priorities are priorities."

    na "To be fair to her, she's been trying very hard to learn as much as she can. She wants to help me, bless her soul."

    na "While I could do all of this on my own, she wants to help, and it's best that I let her."

    na "It makes her really happy, and that, oddly enough, makes me pretty happy too."

    na "Giving Raine's hardware one final checkup, I give Leona the word."

    na "She flips a breaker, allowing power to flow to the transformer."

    na "A little bit of my anxiety fades. The first step was successful. The nuclear plant powering the city did its job, and the transformer did the same."

    na "From there, a measured amount of electricity flows into Juneau."

    na "..."

    na "At first, nothing happens. After I give it a few light taps, something jostles into place, and a status light blinks on."

    na "Yellow. That's better than nothing. Juneau is accepting power at least, but it needs some more time to warm up."

    na "I hook Juneau up to the hologram projector I salvaged from the ship."

    na "She won't be able to formbe hard light just yet, but at least she'll be on display."

    na "The light blinks slowly, then quickly, eventually becoming a solid green."

    na "Honestly, I don't know if I'll be able to get this thing flying again. So many parts are ripped up, dented, melted or downright missing."

    #VA sigh

    na "I stretch out my arms, ready for a very, very long day."

    na "To the left of that, there's a collection of parts that I assume came from… some other civilization?"

    na "This looks absolutely ancient, but in true sci fi fashion, it's easily more advanced than whatever the locals have."

    na "Some of this I can actually use!"

    na "Rifling through it, there's plenty that'll help me get basic functions online, like life support and carbon dioxide scrubbing."

    na "Hell, there's stuff here I can probably use to streamline my ship. Maybe the poor thing won't get torn apart next time I happen upon a wormhole."

    na "However, the one thing that's missing also happens to be the heart of the ship - the drive."

    na "With only the stuff on hand, I won't be able to get the ship to hover in atmosphere, let alone leave it."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-38.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-39.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-40.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-41.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-45.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-46.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "I see. So it keeps the engines clean?"

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-47.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Something like that. It cleans the residue that comes from mixing plasma with hectiactic neuroparticulates before injecting the mixture into the compression chambers."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-48.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "I should be able to fabricate new ones using some of the materials in the yard, but that won't matter anyway."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-51.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Well normally, probably. Juneau has the design specifications in her head. The problem is that in order to make I.O.S.C chips, you need a stable warp field…"

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-52.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "And the only way to generate a warp field is to have I.O.S.Cs controlling it."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-53.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "Huh? How does that even work? Where did the first one come from?"

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-54.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-55.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-56.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-57.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Like your people come from Dawne, my people came from a single planet too, and we made a lot of colonies. That was a really long time ago."

    le "What was it called?"

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-59.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-60.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "I wonder what it was like..."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-61.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "I heard it was beautiful once. Humans don't have much reason to go there anymore."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-62.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "I think I'd still want to go see Dawne someday, even if it takes a while to get there."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-63.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "How is it there?"

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-64.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "A lot like Fireside, but there are cities everywhere."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-65.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "I'm happy I was born here though. Something about all the nature feels, I dunno, right?"

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-66.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Hmm, you've lost me there. I prefer being up there, in space."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-67.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "So, if Fireside is sort of like my backyard, space is yours?"

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-68.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "And if you find more of those chips you'll leave?"

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-69.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Well..."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-70.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Even if I found more chips, they could be the wrong type, which is likely considering there's virtually zero chance of whoever was here first being human."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-71.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "And if that's the case, it could take some time to reconfigure them to work in my warp drive.."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-72.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "...then I could find a bunch of other problems I simply can't see yet. Once I have the parts, troubleshooting might reveal a host of other issues."

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-73.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "So it'll be awhile?"

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-74.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-75.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-76.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-79.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/5-scene_5-81.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)

    na "Leona continues forward, ahead of me. I walk quietly and carefully behind her, trusting her as the expert here."

    na "Artificial. Let's go with that. Speaking of…"

    na "A glint on the cave wall catches my eye, Leona's flashlight reflecting off of something shiny."

    na "I move off, my curiosity getting the better of me. It's probably just some glossy rock covered in water, or some common metal."

    na "Putting my hand on it, I feel a little bit of both."

    na "Probably just some iron or something. Hell, I don't know anything about caves, but iron is pretty common right?"

    na "Looking over towards Leona, I realize it's become gotten pitch black."

    na "Where'd Leona go?"

    na "Fuck, I should have said something. I'm so used to exploring on my own in my element, that I forgot the one rule: stay with the guide."

    na "Okay, okay, okay, let's think about this."

    na "When lost, those who die are those who wander. If I sit still Leona will notice that I'm gone, and come and find me."

    na "She can probably smell me, too."

    na "I'm tempted to yell out, but maybe that'd confuse her? I'm sure my #voice echoing through the cave would hurt her little goat ears."

    na "After everything I've been through, this is what gets me, huh?"

    na "Survived many, many years in the cold vacuum of space, falling through a wormhole onto an alien planet, only to die in cold, wet cave."

    na "I sit down, holding my legs in front of me, leaning back on the wall."

    na "If I were in my shoes, I'm sure I'd feel the same. Being the reason why Leona…"

    na "That train of thought is too terrifying to continue."
