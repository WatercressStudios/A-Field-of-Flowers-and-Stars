    na "Heading out of the cave system, we're greeted by still air and a setting sun. Slowly, the creatures of the night wake, chirping and chittering underneath shrubs and dusty rocks."

    na "I'm sure they're just the Fireside equivalent to Earth's long lost grasshoppers and cicadas."

    na "The surrounding air is warm, but cooling down in the way arid climates do."

    na "With the setting of the sun, Leona uses the last moments of light to feverishly read her alien books."

    na "She's mentioned that they may only be instruction manuals, but she was excited nonetheless."

    na "Ultimately, I can read the books too. My translation chip also works on written text. I just don't have the heart to tell her."

    na "I'm letting her have this one. She deserves it."

    na "Even if they are just inventory sheets and maintenance logs. The thrill of the chase, right? Journey over destination."

    na "And she {i}really{/i} wants to be a part of my journey until the end."

    na "She will, too."

    na "It's odd. She wants to help me, but doesn't want me to go. She's... interesting like that."

    na "Naive, in an endearing way. Ultimately, Leonashe wants what's best for me. She wants to support me, even if it hurts her."

    na "She probably could have hidden the parts I needed better, if she really wanted to. I may be wrong, but..."

    na "I think she just wanted me to know."

    na "She should have just talked to me."

    na "Dummy."

    na "The rest of the light falls below the horizon. Leona made sure to put her books down and watch, as bright as ever."

    na "Leaving the tent flap open, she makes sure to watch the evening meteor shower, only snuggling up in her sleeping bag once the event comes to a close."

    na "...Man, I wish these sleeping bags were a little bigger."

    na "I'd join her in a heartbeat, space permitting."

    na "Instead, she beats me to the punch, scooting her bag ever so slightly closer to mine."

    na "I pretend not to notice, and she scoots closer. And closer. And closer."

    na  "I can't wait to take you up in the morning. I've learned so much, getting to see what you see."

    na "Now I'll be able to return the favor."
