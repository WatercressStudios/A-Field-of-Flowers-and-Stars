    na "Heading out of the cave system, we're greeted by still air and a setting sun. Slowly, the creatures of the night wake, chirping and chittering underneath shrubs and dusty rocks."

    na "I'm sure they're just the Fireside equivalent to Earth's long lost grasshoppers and cicadas."

    na "The surrounding air is warm, but cooling down in the way arid climates do."

    le "We should settle in the tent until morning! IWhile it would be no problem to make the trek back home, but I like camping!"

    le "Seeing the sun set outside of the city is super duper cool, right?"

    mc "Yeah, that's true. Rooftops can get in the way down here."

    mc "Now, if you were in space, you could see it regardless."

    mc "...but then you'd have no sunrise or sunset. Just a floating ball of cosmic fire."

    le "If you can fly, then just land whenever you want! There's always a sunset somewhere in the world."

    mc "True, true."

    na "With the setting of the sun, Leona uses the last moments of light to feverishly read her alien books."

    na "She's mentioned that they may only be instruction manuals, but she was excited nonetheless."

    na "Ultimately, I can read the books too. My translation chip also works on written text. I just don't have the heart to tell her."

    na "I'm letting her have this one. She deserves it."

    na "Even if they are just inventory sheets and maintenance logs. The thrill of the chase, right? Journey over destination."

    na "And she {i}really{/i} wants to be a part of my journey until the end."

    na "She will, too."

    na "It's odd. She wants to help me, but doesn't want me to go. She's... interesting like that."

    na "Naive, in an endearing way. Ultimately, Leonashe wants what's best for me. She wants to support me, even if it hurts her."

    na "She probably could have hidden the parts I needed better, if she really wanted to. I may be wrong, but..."

    na "I think she just wanted me to know."

    na "She should have just talked to me."

    na "Dummy."

    na "The rest of the light falls below the horizon. Leona made sure to put her books down and watch, as bright as ever."

    na "Leaving the tent flap open, she makes sure to watch the evening meteor shower, only snuggling up in her sleeping bag once the event comes to a close."

    na "...Man, I wish these sleeping bags were a little bigger."

    na "I'd join her in a heartbeat, space permitting."

    na "Instead, she beats me to the punch, scooting her bag ever so slightly closer to mine."

    na "I pretend not to notice, and she scoots closer. And closer. And closer."

    mc "Getting a little cold?"

    le "Y-Yeah! It's just the frigid air is all. No other reason, no!"

    na "Putting her face right up next to mine, she nudges me like a... cat."

    na "I pat her on the head."

    le "You're the best thing that's happened to me, Raine."

    le "When I first found you all tangled up in that tree, I have to admit, I was very curious!"

    le "And a little nervous, too."

    le "But you were always so kind to me."

    le "Not everyone can handle how..."

    mc "Insatiable?"

    le "{i}Adventurous{/i} as I can be."

    le "But you indulged me! Very few can do that for so long."

    le "You're the best adventure I've ever found there, dangling from a tree, strapped to a chair!"

    na "Giving her a couple final pats, I look into her eyes."

    mc "You're the best adventure I've ever found, waiting here through a wormhole, on the other end of the universe."

    na "I give her a light, admittedly uncharacteristic peck on the forehead."

    #That damned smile
    na "There it is. That wonderful smile of yours."

    na  "I can't wait to take you up in the morning. I've learned so much, getting to see what you see."

    na "Now I'll be able to return the favor."
