    na "The walk home is peaceful and uneventful. Not much conversation is had - the silence is of a comfortable kind, one shared between two good friends."

    na "Despite her being so loud and bubbly, I don't find myself as annoyed by her as I'd expect myself to be."

    na "She isn't annoying."

    na "{i}She's cute.{/i}"

    na "Really, really cute."

    na "Our personalities aren't at odds, they're complementary."

    na "She distracts me from my troubles without devaluing or silencing them."

    na "No, she'd always listen. That's just the person she seems to be. But I've only known her for all of a few weeks."

    na "...Maybe I fell too hard?"

    mc "Why'd you take me to your roof? This isn't any different from the cafe."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-2.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "Shushushush! Check out the view!"

    na "Squeezing my hand tight, she plops herself on the ground."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-3.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Wha-Oh."

    na "I follow suit, stretching myself out, back to the ground and face towards the stars."

    na "And by god, {i}are there stars.{/i}"

    na "It's a strange scene, seeing the warm glow of the sunset juxtaposed against the blues and blacks around the bright pinprick stars."

    na "I can see stars like these wherever and whenever I want, but..."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-4.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "I thought they'd be different, seeing 'em down here from our perspective."

    na "She turns her body, gazing into me with her deep auburn eyes."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-5.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "Was I right?"

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-6.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "..."

    #Gotta have that dank lonely ellipses, or it wouldn't be an EVN, right?

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-7.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Yeah. I never thought about it, but I don't think I've seen a sight like this in a very, very long time."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-8.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "The last time was... my childhood home, I think. Way back on Lumin."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-9.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Due to a terraforming mishap, wild wheat grew in groves all throughout the largest continent."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-10.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "I used to walk through the fields, finding my special spot among the sea of tan and gold. Unlike humanity's homeworld, Lumin had regular, frequent meteor showers."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-11.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "You could see them every night, falling from above, streaks of light floating across the sky."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-12.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Venturing out to the cove I dug for myself, I'd lay on my back, just like this. I'd stare up at the stars hoping that one day I too would wander among them."

    na "Up until now, I never realized what I was missing, way back then."

    na "The glaring problem with that daily moment in time."

    na "Unlike the meteors..."

    na "I was always alone."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-13.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "Then you're in luck! We're just in time for ours!"

    na "As if on cue, one by one bright lights slowly move along the horizon, following the gradient between the sun and the stars."

    na "I can see them, perfectly reflecting on Leona's wide eyes. She has such a genuine smile. All of her expression has such a sense of {i}wonder{/i} in it."

    na "This is a scene she's probably seen a thousand times, and yet she still comes here to see the stars."

    na "To see the bits of rock and dust, falling from space."

    na "Something so boring, so utterly mundane, and yet she enjoys it now just as much as she did when she was a child."

    na "You're right, Leona. You'll never take this for granted."

    na "I came here chasing that fleeting sense of adventure. Hoping that I'd find something that'd fill that hole in my soul."

    na "I didn't come here expecting to fall in love."

    na "But I guess that's an adventure in of itself, yeah?"

    na "It's a little frightening, but..."

    na "It's the first true adventure I've had in my life."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-14.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "I'd love to spread my wings, ya know that?"

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-15.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "Just like you when you were a little kid! I'd love to see more of what's out there!"

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-16.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "But I'd have to leave my home."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-17.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "And this is the only home I've ever known."

    na "Leona closes her eyes, bringing her hands to her chest, clasping them together."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-18.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "This {b}is{/b} my home."

    #voice "voice/7-scene_7-19.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "Maybe I just get too attached too quickly, but I'd miss this sunset more than anything! I'm a little emotional like that, I guess."

    na "We continue to watch the shower as it slowly dwindles to nothingness. The sun has set, and we're left with the blues and blacks of the lonely pinprick stars"

    na "Leona's breathing settles into the familiar lull of sleep."

    na "I wonder how many times she's been in this exact position?"

    na "Hoping for more, but wishing, somewhat selfishly, that it'd come without sacrifice?"

    na "Was it the same for me, I wonder?"

    na "No."

    na "No, it wasn't."

    na "And it'd be unfair of me to ask her to do something I never had to do myself."

    na "No. I shouldn't ask her to leave her home. Not for space, and not for me."

    na "But... ultimately, I think I will."

    na "The universe would be a brighter place with her by my side. At the very least, as a thanks for all that she's done for me, I'll take her for a ride one last time before I leave."

    na "Assuming I get my ship up and running in time, of course."

    na "But that can come later. For now, I should get some sleep."

    na "We have a big day tomorrow, don't we?"
