    na "It's been nearly two weeks since we first found the caves. We've been making excellent progress on the vault, and it appears we'll be able to open it very, very soon."

    na "After finishing up our work for the day, we convene together for the night."

    le "So!"

    mc "So?"

    le "What now? Wanna go explore the city? Get something to eat, maybe a drink? There's this wonderful drink that gets you all energized!"

    mc "What, coffee?"

    le "What? Coffee?"

    le "I don't know what that is, but there's a local shop that makes the greatest stuff! They have cute little tables and chairs, and a bunch of sweets that pair well with the drink."

    le "It tastes a bit bitter if you drink it alone, but with the right cream, it's wonderful!"

    mc "You... you want to go to a cafe."

    le "I don't know what that is, but sure!"

    na "I let out a slow chuckle. A cafe. How metropolitan."

    na "I guess even country bumpkins have taste."

    mc "Alright. I'm down."

    na "Leona's face lights up like the sun."

    le "Yes! It's a date! Let's go right now!"

    mc "Right now?"

    le "Yesyesyes!"

    mc "I-okay, sure. Let's go-"

    na "Before I have a chance to finish my sentence, Leona grabs me by the hand and rushes me towards the door."

    na "I hear Juneau give a snarky comment about marriage on the way out."

    na "I answer her in kind."

    mc "Oh, piss off June!"

    na "After a short walk down the street, we find it."

    na "Centrally located near Leona's house and where my ship lays, the coffee shop settles neatly between an eatery and what appears to be a communications shop."

    na "It really is a cafe."

    na "Nestled right against the walls of the neighboring stores, it feels comfy, an alcove hidden away from the vibrant noise of the city proper."

    na "A bonafide cafe. Just like the many I've seen on my travels throughout the universe."

    na "As if to gently remind one of the city it belongs to, the seating area lies on the roof - a veranda, sunbaked and warm in its lofty heights."

    na "This one, however, is different. There's an atmosphere, a sort of culture that lingers heavy in the air."

    na "Here, anyone can belong."

    na "It's different among the stars where, through anonymity, differences fall out of the public consciousness."

    na "Rather, here, everyone travels among the same streets, trodding upon the same dusty ground - where an alien like myself can find home among the pleasantries of the locals."

    na "Space is cold and uncaring. Here, on Fireside, everyone and everything matters."

    na "Where people like Leona, people who have every reason not to trust me, somehow do."

    na "They take care of their own, and everyone who lives here no matter how transient does indeed belong."

    na "But it's no replacement."

    na "This warmth is only temporary. I will grow bored of this place, and I will move on."

    na "One day I'll find what I'm looking for."

    le "Raaaaaine? Raaaaaaaaaaaine? RAINE!"

    mc "I-uh, what? Hmm?"

    le "Pick your brew! The poor barista's been waiting for you. I know it sucks that your ship's banged up, but we can worry about that later, yeah?"

    mc "Right. Sorry."

    le "It's okay! Everyone {i}spaces{/i} out from time to time."

    na "Please, god no."

    le "Spacing out? Get it? Cause you're from space?"

    mc "I'll take the darkest shit you have."

    le "Awww, don't be like that."

    mc "Hey, I like it bitter."

    le "Bitter? Oh, you don't want dark, then."

    mc "I-Oh, right. This isn't really coffee, not like I'm used to. Just get me whatever's bitter, please."

    le "And I'll take my usual! Thank you thank you!"

    mc "So, what bean is this stuff made from again?"

    le "No beans! It's made from the best fung-"

    mc "{b}Nevermind{/b}, nevermind. I didn't hear a thing, I don't want to hear a thing, I'm good."

    le "But it's-"

    mc "Noooope. Nope."

    le "No fun..."

    na "After fetching our... caffeinated drinks and topping them off with cream, Leona leads me up a small staircase up to the veranda."

    na "Chairs are oriented closest to the side of the sunset, arrayed with umbrellas for cover."

    na "Of the several customers, most have the umbrella closed, enjoying the heat of the sun on their skin."

    na "We follow their lead, sitting against the partition overlooking the streetside."

    le "The sun's beautiful, isn't it? Apparently this planet was chosen for its similarity to our home. A big 'ol star, with a very nice, warm planet snuggled close by."

    mc "It's a bit arid, though. A little too hot for me."

    le "Says you, voidborn! It's perfect here for us."

    mc "Hey, you know I'm not initially from space. I was born on the ground just like the rest of you."

    na "Yes, this sun reminds me of my birth planet. A familiar main sequence star, only closer and a little more massive, ever so slightly larger in the sky."

    le "Why would you ever give that up? It's so dark out there. So colorless. Here you have trees and wind and lakes and plants and animals and-"

    mc "Doesn't that get a bit boring to you, though?"

    le "How could it?"

    le "There's always something more to see here! We haven't even begun to scratch the surface. Just think, we are the first children of our civilization!"

    mc "This isn't a frontier for us like it is for you. We've been a part of the galactic community for a very, very long while, every system is just another space in time."

    le "Another space to explore."

    mc "There's only so many permutations out there. A planet's a planet, a star's a star."

    na "She looks off towards the now setting sun."

    le "That's a little cynical. I hope we'll never be like that."

    le "I-I don't mean any disrespect! It's just kinda... sad."

    na "...Yeah. It is. I'm not normally this down, am I? Maybe it's just my ship that's getting me a little depressed."

    na "The ever looming specter of that damn wormhole is getting to me."

    na "I need to leave this planet so badly, and yet I feel caught in its gravity."

    le "If I could fly, I'd never take it for granted. Never, ever ever."

    mc "You know, I can see that. You don't seem the cynical type."

    le "You bet!"

    mc "I hope one day you'll get to experience the stars. I think you'd get a lot out of it."

    le "Yeah. Maybe one day, heh."

    na "I continue to sip on my drink, enjoying the strange yet enticing consistency. It tastes really good. Really, really good."

    na "Like nothing I've ever had before."

    na "Man, I'll miss this if I leave."

    na "{i}When{/i} I leave."

    na "I can't give up on my ship just yet. Maybe tomorrow will lend a return on my investment here. Leaving soon would be best, before I tire of this place too."

    na "Leave with a fond memory or two."

    na "A fond memory of you."

    le "Oh! You've finished your drink. Want a refill? Did you like it? I hope you liked it!"

    mc "Yeah, it was really good, thank you. Better than any coffee I've ever had. And no, I very much still don't want to know what's in it."

    na "Just thinking about what she was about to say sends shivers down my spine. Fucking gross. And delicious. But oh so {i}gross{/i}."

    mc "I'm good for now, though. Maybe we can grab another drink before I leave."

    le "Maybe."

    le "So! Let's head back to the house. I have something I want to show you!"

    mc "Oh?"

    le "Yep! I think you could use a little reminder, so to speak. Just you wait!"

    mc "Alright, let's go."

    mc "By the way, where do you put the trash?"

    le "Over here. We recycle, of course!"
