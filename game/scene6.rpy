    na "It's been nearly two weeks since we first found the caves. We've been making excellent progress on the vault, and it appears we'll be able to open it very, very soon."

    na "After finishing up our work for the day, we convene together for the night."

    #voice "voice/6-scene_6-5.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/6-scene_6-6.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "I don't know what that is, but there's a local shop that makes the greatest stuff! They have cute little tables and chairs, and a bunch of sweets that pair well with the drink."

    #voice "voice/6-scene_6-9.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)

    na "I guess even country bumpkins have taste."

    na "Before I have a chance to finish my sentence, Leona grabs me by the hand and rushes me towards the door."

    na "I hear Juneau give a snarky comment about marriage on the way out."

    na "I answer her in kind."

    #voice "voice/6-scene_6-15.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Oh, piss off June!"

    na "After a short walk down the street, we find it."

    na "Centrally located near Leona's house and where my ship lays, the coffee shop settles neatly between an eatery and what appears to be a communications shop."

    na "It really is a cafe."

    na "Nestled right against the walls of the neighboring stores, it feels comfy, an alcove hidden away from the vibrant noise of the city proper."

    na "A bonafide cafe. Just like the many I've seen on my travels throughout the universe."

    na "As if to gently remind one of the city it belongs to, the seating area lies on the roof - a veranda, sunbaked and warm in its lofty heights."

    na "This one, however, is different. There's an atmosphere, a sort of culture that lingers heavy in the air."

    na "Here, anyone can belong."

    na "It's different among the stars where, through anonymity, differences fall out of the public consciousness."

    na "Rather, here, everyone travels among the same streets, trodding upon the same dusty ground - where an alien like myself can find home among the pleasantries of the locals."

    na "Space is cold and uncaring. Here, on Fireside, everyone and everything matters."

    na "Where people like Leona, people who have every reason not to trust me, somehow do."

    na "They take care of their own, and everyone who lives here no matter how transient does indeed belong."

    na "But it's no replacement."

    na "This warmth is only temporary. I will grow bored of this place, and I will move on."

    na "One day I'll find what I'm looking for."

    na "After fetching our... caffeinated drinks and topping them off with cream, Leona leads me up a small staircase up to the veranda."

    na "Chairs are oriented closest to the side of the sunset, arrayed with umbrellas for cover."

    na "Of the several customers, most have the umbrella closed, enjoying the heat of the sun on their skin."

    na "We follow their lead, sitting against the partition overlooking the streetside."

    #voice "voice/6-scene_6-34.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "The sun's beautiful, isn't it? Apparently this planet was chosen for its similarity to our home. A big 'ol star, with a very nice, warm planet snuggled close by."

    #voice "voice/6-scene_6-35.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)

    #voice "voice/6-scene_6-37.ogg" #Raine (VA Name)
    mc "Hey, you know I'm not initially from space. I was born on the ground just like the rest of you."

    na "Yes, this sun reminds me of my birth planet. A familiar main sequence star, only closer and a little more massive, ever so slightly larger in the sky."

    #voice "voice/6-scene_6-38.ogg" #Leona (VA Name)
    le "Why would you ever give that up? It's so dark out there. So colorless. Here you have trees and wind and lakes and plants and animals and-"
