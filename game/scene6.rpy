    na "After a short walk down the street, we find it."

    na "Centrally located near Leona's house and where my ship lays, the coffee shop settles neatly between an eatery and what appears to be a communications shop."

    na "It really is a cafe."

    na "Nestled right against the walls of the neighboring stores, it feels comfy, an alcove hidden away from the vibrant noise of the city proper."

    na "A bonafide cafe. Just like the many I've seen on my travels throughout the universe."

    na "As if to gently remind one of the city it belongs to, the seating area lies on the roof - a veranda, sunbaked and warm in its lofty heights."

    na "This one, however, is different. There's an atmosphere, a sort of culture that lingers heavy in the air."

    na "Here, anyone can belong."

    na "It's different among the stars where, through anonymity, differences fall out of the public consciousness."

    na "Rather, here, everyone travels among the same streets, trodding upon the same dusty ground - where an alien like myself can find home among the pleasantries of the locals."

    na "Space is cold and uncaring. Here, on Fireside, everyone and everything matters."

    na "Where people like Leona, people who have every reason not to trust me, somehow do."

    na "They take care of their own, and everyone who lives here no matter how transient does indeed belong."

    na "But it's no replacement."

    na "This warmth is only temporary. I will grow bored of this place, and I will move on."
